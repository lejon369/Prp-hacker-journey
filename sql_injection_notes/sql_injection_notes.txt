 What is SQL Injection?

    SQL Injection (SQLi) is when a hacker inserts evil code into an input field (like a login box) that tricks the database into doing something it's not supposed to do â€” like giving access without a         password.

ðŸ’£ Example:
   Letâ€™s say a normal login system does this:

 sql:SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'lejon' AND password = '12345';


Now, imagine the attacker types this in the username field:
bash: ' OR '1'='1


The SQL becomes:  SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = '';


 Real Life Attack:
Used in breaches like the Sony Pictures hack, Heartland Payment Systems, and more.


ðŸ§  Fun Fact:
SQLi was #1 in OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities for years. Even big companies screw this up.
